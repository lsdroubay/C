## Discussion on Class Objectives

In this class, I imagine that we will be learning the theory and then implementation of routines and algorithms involved in linear algebra. This could be multiple methods to solve a system of equations or methods to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors. As mentioned at
[encyclopedia of math](https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Linear_algebra_software_packages)
this becomes useful when you are doing very large systems. Anyone can do a 3 x 3 system by hand. But when we get on the order of hundreds, thousands, millions, and more, this is impossible or too time consuming by hand. On a computer, a 100 x 100 system can be solved in seconds. As mentioned 
[here](https://nickhigham.wordpress.com/2017/03/06/parallel-numerical-linear-algebra-for-extreme-scale-systems/)
parallel processing can be used to do numerical linear algebra for extreme scale systems.

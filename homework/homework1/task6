## Analysis of 3 Disasters

### Patriot Missile Failure

The patriot missile was designed to track an intercept incoming enemy missiles. The missile failed to intercept an enemy missile though on February 25, 1991 because of errors in the calculation of time since the missile system was booted. Time was measured every 1/10 of a second, but using a 24-bit system. 1/10 has more than 24 bits and was thus truncated. This resulted in an error of 0.000000095 every tenth of a second. The system was booted for 100 hours resulting in an error of 0.34 seconds, plenty of time for an enemy missile traveling at 1,676 meters per second to avoid interception.

### Ariane 5 Rocket Explosion
An unmanned rocket that cost $7 billion and a decade to develop, exploded on June 4, 1996. The problem was due to a software error in the rocketâ€™s reference system, causing the missile to self-destruct. A 64 bit floating point number used for the horizontal velocity of the rocket was being converted to a 16 bit signed integer. The largest storeable integer in a 16 bit signed integer is 32767. The value reached higher than this and the conversion failed.

### Sleipner A Platform Sinking
When placed in the water, the some of the concrete ballast cracked and broke, causing the whole platform to sink. The issue was innacurate approximations used for the finite element analysis of a tricell between ballasts. As a mechanical engineering student who has studied finite element analysis, I am curious to find more details on the errors from the analysis. When a more careful finite element analysis was performed, the failure was indeed predicted.

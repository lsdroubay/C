## Task 10

It was hard for me to understand what the term "inuced norm" meant. I understand in general what a norm is for both 
vectors and matrices. I also understand how to compute them, where feasible. The term "induced" still escaped me.

As I was doing some research, I came upon an [article](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/122104019/numerical-analysis/kadalbajoo/lec1/fnode3.html) that explained it in a way that made sense to me. Often we are
concerned with both vector norms and matrix norms, and so it would be unwise to use different norms for each.
So we derive a matrix norm "induced' by a vector norm. Here is a [table](https://lsdroubay.github.io/math5610/homework/homework2/normtable.PNG) that shows both vector and matrix norms and how they relate.

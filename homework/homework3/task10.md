## Task 10

The Frobenius norm is a norm that takes the square root of the sum of the squared absolute value all the terms of the matirix.
This is different than the 1-norm or inf-norm that find max values of column or row sums. [Reference](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FrobeniusNorm.html)

The Frobenius norm is a consistent norm. According to the all-knowing [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_norm#Consistent_norms), a matrix norm ||*|| is consistent with vector
norm ||*||a and a vector norm ||*||b if ||Ax||b <= ||A|| ||x||a. All induced norms are consistent.

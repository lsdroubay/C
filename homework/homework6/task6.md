## Task 6

The [Gauss-Seidel](https://lsdroubay.github.io/math5610/softwaremanual/GaussSeidel)method was implemented and tested. One of the test was done for a 
1200 x 1200 sytem with the max number of iterations being 20 and the tolerance 10e-6; The A matrix was made with code for
creating [random diagonally dominant matrices](https://lsdroubay.github.io/math5610/softwaremanual/DiagonalMatrix). The b matrix was calculated from A and a known x. x was then
solved for using Gauss-Seidel. The average error of the new approximation was output;

```
Average Error = 3.60134e-07
```

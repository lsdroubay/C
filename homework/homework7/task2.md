## Task 2

```
Rows      Gauss time    GauSei time
5          2            89
100        2949         23474
700        794127       976838
1200       3.99743e+06  2.84855e+06
3000       7.43828e+07  1.86473e+07
```
After the system is larger than 1000, Gauss-Seidel seem to be faster. I guess that's the rule after all.
